{"name":"Rashumon","tagline":"Rashumon was the first multi-lingual word processor for the Amiga, Invented by Michael Haephrati","body":"**Rashumon** was a multilingual graphical word processor developed for the Amiga computer. It was developed by HarmonySoft, (a software venture founded by [[Michael Haephrati]] in 1989), and was sold until 1994, right after Commodore Amiga has gone bankrupt.\r\n![Rashumon by Michael Haephrati](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Rashumon_Screen.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Notable features\r\n\r\nRashumon used to have features, some of which were revolutionary these days among them (This list is taken from Rashumon's README file):\r\n\r\n* Multiple selections, meaning that unlike most other word processors, the end user can select multiple parts of the text -- even if these parts are separated from each other -- and perform clipboard manipulations on them (e.g. selecting the first paragraph and the last paragraph of a document at the same time, and copying both of them to the clipboard).\r\n* A Table generator, allowing the creation and editing of tables.\r\n* Multiple key map support, up to 5 simultaneously, allowing for the use of multiple languages simultaneously.\r\n* Search and replace including color, style and font filters. For example, end users could search for the word \"Apple\" only in green (ignoring this word in other colors) and replace each occurrence with the word \"Banana\" in yellow.\r\n* Multilingual string gadgets (the Amiga equivalent to text boxes) for creating and renaming files, drawers, etc.\r\n* Import and export multilingual ASCII files to and from PC and Macintosh, i.e. ASCII (plain text) files from different platforms.\r\n* Ultra fast screen updating and scrolling.\r\n* Interchange File Format (IFF) graphics support (import and export).\r\n* Direct access to 255 characters of each font, similar to inserting \"symbols\" or \"special characters\" in modern word processor.\r\n\r\n![Rashumon print sample and ad from 1989](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Rashumon_-_Print_Sample.jpg)\r\n\r\n## External links\r\n* [Rashumon versions at Aminet.net](http://aminet.net/search?query=rashumon)\r\n* [Personal web site of [[Michael Haephrati]], the inventor of Rashumon](http://michaelhaephrati.wordpress.com)\r\n* [Rashumon's web site](http://www.rashumon.com)\r\n* [An article about Rashumon at codeproject.com](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/290729/Developing-multi-lingual-support-as-part-of-the-de)\r\n\r\n![Rashumon floppy disk](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Rashumon_Floppy_Disk.jpg)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
